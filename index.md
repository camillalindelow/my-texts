I'm a PhD-student at the Swedish School of Library and Information Science/University of Borås. Prior to this I worked for many years in university libraries (Stockholm University and Södertörn University) as well as the National Library of Sweden. I've come to specialise in Scholarly communication, open science and scientometrics.
